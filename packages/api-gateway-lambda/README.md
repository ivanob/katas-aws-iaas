### Goals
The objective is to build an API served by API-gateway and with some lambdas listening

 - [X] Add a simple method GET that accepts a query parameter and returns an entity
 - [ ] Add a POST method to put some data in the DB (DB is mocked, so I will just console.log it)
 - [ ] Add authentication?
 - [ ] Add some different error types in the return (403, 402...)
